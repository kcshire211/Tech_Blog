## Description
This application is a CMS-style blog that allows a user to publish articles, blog posts, thoughts, and opinions. When the user first visits the site, they are provided with a home page that shows existing published blog posts. The user will see a Log In button that redirects to a log in and sign up page if a new user. If the user attempts to access other pages of the site prior to logging in, they will be directed to this log in page. When a user first signs up, they are prompted to input their name and choose a username and minimum 8 character password. Upon successful sign up, or log in if an existing user, they will be directed to the dashboard or profile page. Here, the user will see any posts they have previously submitted, along with having the ability to delete existing posts. On this same page, they have the option to create a new post by assigning a title and content. A save button will capture this new post in the post history section. Once posted, the post is displayed on the home page for users and non-users to see. There, other users have the ability to add comments to each post.
